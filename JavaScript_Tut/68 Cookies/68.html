        What are Cookies? <br>
        Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
        <br>
        When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, and the server forgets everything about the user.
        
        Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":
        
        <li> When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.</li>
        <li>
            Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.

        </li>
        <p>
            Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like:
        <br>
        username = John Doe <br>
        When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.
        </p>

        // setting cookies:
        // it is a simply key-value pair:
        document.cookie = "name1 = Rahul"  // it doesn't overwrite it simply add a new cookie in computer.
        document.cookie = "name2 = Abhishek"

        let key = prompt("Enter your key: ")
        let value = prompt("Enter your value: ")
        // document.cookie= `${key} = ${value}`
        // to encode your key value:
        document.cookie= `${encodeURIComponent(key)} = ${encodeURIComponent(value)}` // it actual encode special character ('',: ,=..etc) in string.

        // to decode:
        console.log("decoded key is : ",decodeURIComponent(key))
        console.log("decoded value is : ",decodeURIComponent(value))


        console.log(document.cookie)
