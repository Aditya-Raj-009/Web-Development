    <h2>Downfall of using callback function:</h2>

    <p>Pyramid of doom:
        when we have callback inside callback, the code gets
        difficult tp manage.This is sometimes called 'callback hell' or 'Pyramid of doom'. The 'Pyramid' of these calls grows towards the right with every asynchronous action.
    </p>
    <p>
        Itroduction to promises:
        The  solution to the callback hell is promises. A promises is a proomise of code execute. The code either execute or fail in both cases the subscriber will be notified.
